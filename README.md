# Which Python Libraries did you use in this project?

In this project, I used several Python libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.

Scikit-learn: To build and train the machine learning classification models.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing the data and results.

TensorFlow: For building and training a neural network model to improve classification performance.

# Project Content and Objective:

In this project, the AI model is trained on thousands of fish species across various categories. After learning from the provided data, it predicts the species of fish from new images, identifying which type of fish it belongs to. The aim is to apply machine learning techniques for accurate image-based species classification.

#

# Best Model Accuracy

The best model accuracy refers to how well the AI correctly predicts the fish species from the given images. In this project, the model achieved an accuracy of 90.33%, meaning it correctly classified fish species in 90.33% of the test cases. This result reflects the effectiveness of the model in handling the task of species prediction.

# Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix is used to evaluate a model's performance and includes four key components: True Positive (TP), which are the instances correctly classified as positive by the model; True Negative (TN), which are the instances correctly classified as negative; False Positive (FP), which are the instances incorrectly classified as positive; and False Negative (FN), which are the instances incorrectly classified as negative. These components help us understand the model's prediction accuracy and the types of errors it makes.

# Model Accuracy and Loss

The graph illustrates key metrics related to the model's performance during training and validation. Model accuracy indicates the percentage of correct predictions made by the model, while model loss reflects the difference between predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better performance. 

Training accuracy shows how well the model performs on the training dataset, whereas validation accuracy evaluates its performance on unseen data, helping to assess the model's generalization ability. Overall, this graph provides a comprehensive view of the model's learning process and effectiveness.
